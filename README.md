The Photography website is a personal project designed to showcase a collection of photographs and the story behind the photographer. It includes a biography, a gallery of favorite photos, and a contact form for visitors to reach out. 
The project leverages HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and basic JavaScript for form validation.

This website is a visual representation of my passion for photography and a way for potential clients or admirers to learn more about my work and get in touch.
